            accustomed to the traditional way of writing this unconventional
            approach might be a bit jarring. So we wrote this manifesto to
            provide you with everything you need to survive and thrive in
            content marketing! Whether it’s your first day or one-thousandth, we
            will help you understand how to grow with Craftly.AI, from making
            the most of features to navigating our interface.

          it close when you swim into the deep end.
